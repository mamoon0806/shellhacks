# Shellhacks - Pedestria
This is our Shellhacks 2023 project!<br />

Pedestria is a full-stack web application that makes use of Google's Map API Platform to deliver a safe experience for pedestrians across the globe. Pedestria plots a path between you and your destination, and warns you on potential dangers along said walking path. Heat index, air quality, and the dominant air pollutants are all things that Pedestria provides information on the path that you plan to take.
